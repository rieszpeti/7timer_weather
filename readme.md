In this zip, you'll find a pyhton starter code. It uses a publicly available REST API to get weather forecast data for five big cities. Extend on it to fulfill the following tasks:
1. Use pandas to structure the data, eg. by creating one big dataframe with a city column, and then applying groupby or pivot using the city name
2. Calculate basic statistics from all available data (numerical: min, max, mean, std; categorical: count, unique, top, freq)
3. Give insight to the data with visualization. Be creative and pick a variety of plot types. Possible libraries: pandas builtin, plotly, matplotlib
4. Create one unit test for the REST API endpoint. It shall pass, if there is intelligible weather data in the response for an arbitrary location request
